# Support-Vector-Machine
An another machine learning model that uses classification algorithm for two groups classification.
In this code, we will be making blobs and hence sampling to variable X and Y and further would be using KERNEL trick to convert a low dimensional input space to a high dimensional input space. We will then be comparing the actual dataset with the predicted dataset and visualising via scatterplot and eventually checked the accuracy score of the machine learning model.
